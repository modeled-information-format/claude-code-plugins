# claude-artifact-authoring

Generates high-quality AI-interaction artifacts — prompts, goals, loops,
eval-suites, subagent definitions, and tool schemas — from a natural-language
request plus grounding sources. Every generator shares one pipeline: a scored
authoring checklist, a calibrated eval, and MIF Level-3 provenance persisted to
a central `XDG_DATA_HOME` artifact store, so generated artifacts are versioned,
graded, and discoverable across projects rather than one-off files.

This plugin's design is specified in the architecture doc referenced by
[Epic #40](https://github.com/modeled-information-format/claude-code-plugins/issues/40),
which tracks its build via 14 Stories. This README will grow
generator-by-generator as each Story lands; as of this Story (S3), the plugin
scaffold, the central `XDG_DATA_HOME` artifact store, the cross-cutting
persistence pipeline, and the OTel-compatible trace substrate exist — no
generator is implemented yet.

## Internals

- `lib/xdg-store.mjs` — the central artifact store: resolves
  `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/claude-artifact-authoring/<type>/<slug>/`,
  validates `type`/`slug`/`filename` as safe single path segments (no path
  traversal), writes collision-safe version directories (`v1/`, `v2/`, ...),
  and promotes one version to `current.json` via an atomic write-then-rename.
- `lib/frontmatter-contract.mjs` — validates a drafted frontmatter against
  the four elements every persisted artifact must carry: `citations[]`,
  a `provenance` block (`sourceType: system_generated`), `temporal`
  (`validFrom`/`recordedAt`/`ttl`, checked as a real RFC3339 date-time and a
  simple ISO-8601 duration, not just presence), and `relationships[]`
  (`derived-from`, `relates-to`, `harness:generated-for`, each requiring a
  non-empty `target`).
- `lib/mif-docs-dependency.mjs` — resolves the installed `mif-docs` plugin's
  directory under `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/plugins/cache/...`
  (requiring all three entry points the persistence sequence depends on:
  `mif-frontmatter`, `mif-provenance`, `mif-validate`), or throws a clear,
  actionable error naming exactly what's missing — never a silent no-op.
- `lib/trace.mjs` — a minimal, portable OTel-compatible trace substrate: no
  SDK dependency, spans are OTLP-JSON-shaped objects appended as JSON Lines
  under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/claude-artifact-authoring/traces.jsonl`
  (a different XDG category from the artifact store — telemetry, not durable
  content). `startSpan`/`endSpan`/`writeSpan`/`readTraceSpans` are the whole
  API; no hosted platform, per AD-7.
- `lib/persist-artifact.mjs` — the deterministic half of the persistence
  pipeline: validates the contract, confirms the dependency, writes an
  **unpromoted** draft version, and — when a generator passes `traceId` from
  its own "generation-request" span — records the write as a linked child
  span, so a trace can be walked from request → artifact → (eventually)
  evaluation. `skills/persist-artifact/SKILL.md` documents the full
  four-step sequence (draft via `mif-frontmatter` → write via this module →
  stamp via `mif-provenance` → gate via `mif-validate`, only then promote)
  that every generator Story (S6-S11) runs at the end of its own pipeline.
- `npm test` (Node's built-in test runner, 56 tests) covers all of the
  above, including a **real cross-process** concurrency test for the store
  (separate OS processes, not same-thread async calls, so it actually
  exercises the `EEXIST`-retry path under real contention) and a real
  request → artifact → evaluation trace round-trip.

## Install

**Not yet installable** — this plugin isn't registered in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` yet (that's Story S12, the last Story in
Epic #40's build order). Once it is:

```
/plugin marketplace add modeled-information-format/claude-code-plugins
/plugin install claude-artifact-authoring@modeled-information-format
```

## Depends on

`mif-docs@modeled-information-format` — every generator's persistence pipeline
(Story S2) authors its output via `mif-frontmatter`, stamps it via
`mif-provenance`, and gates it via `mif-validate`.

## Generators (planned; see Epic #40 for build order and status)
